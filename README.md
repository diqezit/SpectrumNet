## ‚ú® Key Features

### üéß Advanced Audio Processing
- **Real-time System Audio Capture:** Captures desktop audio directly using WASAPI loopback‚Äîno extra configuration needed.
- **Multiple FFT Window Functions:** Choose between Hann, Hamming, and Blackman windows to fine-tune the spectral analysis.
- **Flexible Frequency Scaling:** Visualize sound across Linear, Logarithmic, Mel, and Bark frequency scales.

### üé® Powerful Visualization Engine
- **20+ Unique Render Styles:** A vast collection of visualizers, including:
  - **Bars:** Vertical, Circular, LED Meter
  - **Waveforms:** Gradient Line, Heartbeat, Waterfall
  - **Particles:** Fire, Raindrop, Text Effects
  - **Advanced:** Voronoi Diagrams, Spectrum Fractals
- **Dynamic Color Palettes:** Customize your visualizer with beautiful gradient effects and pre-built themes.
- **Adjustable Quality Presets:** Instantly switch between Low, Medium, and High quality settings, with options for manual override to balance performance and visuals.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Customization and Control
- **Flexible Display Modes:** Use in a standard window or as an **Always-on-Top** overlay for seamless integration with your desktop.
- **Configurable Hotkeys:** Control the application without interrupting your workflow (`Start/Stop Capture`, `Toggle Overlay`, `Open Panel`).
- **Real-time Adjustments:** Fine-tune spectrum sensitivity, range, and other parameters on the fly with an interactive control panel.

## üöÄ Getting Started (For Users)

1.  **Download the latest version** from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/diqezit/SpectrumNet/releases) page.
2.  Unzip the archive and run `SpectrumNet.exe`.
3.  Click **"Start Capture"** to begin visualizing your system's audio.
4.  Use the controls and hotkeys to customize your experience:
    - `Space`: Start or stop the visualization.
    - `Ctrl + O`: Toggle the always-on-top overlay mode.
    - `Ctrl + P`: Show or hide the main control panel.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building from Source (For Developers)

### Prerequisites
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)

### Steps
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/diqezit/SpectrumNet.git
    ```
2.  **Open the solution file** (`.sln`) in Visual Studio.
3.  **Restore NuGet packages** (this should happen automatically).
4.  **Build and run** the project in `Debug` or `Release` mode.

## üíª Technology Stack
- **Framework:** .NET 8.0
- **UI:** WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
- **Rendering:** SkiaSharp for high-performance 2D graphics.
- **Audio Capture:** WASAPI Loopback (via a .NET wrapper like CSCore or NAudio).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Transparency Rendering Issues on Intel GPUs
Some users with older or integrated Intel GPUs may experience rendering artifacts in overlay mode.

**Symptoms**:
- Partial or complete loss of window transparency.
- Flickering or visual glitches when interacting with the interface.
- Poor performance in overlay mode.

**Affected Hardware**:
- Primarily observed on Intel HD/UHD Graphics (pre-2021 models).
- Laptops with hybrid graphics systems (NVIDIA Optimus).
- Systems with outdated graphics drivers.

**Workaround**:
1.  **Force Dedicated GPU**: In your NVIDIA or AMD control panel, set `SpectrumNet.exe` to always use the high-performance dedicated GPU.
2.  **(For Developers) Force Software Rendering**: As a last resort, you can disable hardware acceleration by replacing `SKGLElement` with `SKElement` in the relevant XAML files. This will use CPU-based rendering, which is slower but more compatible.
    ```xaml
    <!-- In the visualizer's XAML, replace the hardware-accelerated element: -->
    <skia:SKElement /> 
    
    <!-- Instead of: -->
    <!-- <skia:SKGLElement /> -->
    ```
